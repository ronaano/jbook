# JBook Application

This application is a local browser-based coding environment. You are able to create "cells" which consist of an editor
and a preview window for that editor. There are two types of cells, a Markdown cell and a Code Cell. A markdown cell allows
you to write Markdown and it will display it in the preview window. A code cell allow you to write JS, JSX code inside the editor
and displays it within the preview window. If the user is editing, the preview window only displays the output of the user's code after 250ms. It also saves code and markdown cells created in the environment on the user's machine.

This application was developed with NodeJS, React, Redux and TypeScript
